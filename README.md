# 💰 Expense Splitter

A simple web app that helps groups split expenses **fairly** and **minimize the number of transactions**.  
Built with **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JS** for the frontend.  

The app takes the total payments made by each person, calculates who owes whom, and outputs the minimal set of transactions needed to settle the debts.
